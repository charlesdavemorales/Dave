    <h2>Project Description</h2>
    <p>The Sumobot is an autonomous robot created as part of my first-year engineering project. The robot is programmed to detect and combat other robots within a ring, similar to a sumo wrestling match. It uses sensors to avoid falling off the edge and detect obstacles or opponents.</p>
    <p>We built it using Arduino, basic motors, and sensors. It was a fun and challenging project that helped me learn about robotics, programming, and teamwork.</p>
